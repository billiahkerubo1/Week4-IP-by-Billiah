PROJECT TITLE: AUTOLIB DATA ANALYSIS
This is a decription of the analysis conducted on the Autolib dataset. The main objective of the project was to process stations data to analyse th effective way to conduct the car sharing services. The data used was read by the Pandas library imported. The challenges involved was in data cleaning where I filled the null values but failed to work. I also tried dropping the column but failed. However, since they were irrelevant columns, I ignored them.
PROJECT INSTALLATION
Data analysis was conducted on Google Colab using pandas and numpy libraries.
PROJECT USES
The car-sharing companies can find effective ways to use the reports from the analysis. They can make sure to make profits and reduce costs by using the information obtained from the analysis.
